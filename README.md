# NEWSIFY
An android news app using newsapi.org's REST api for rendering the data in JSON format. 

1. Used AsyncTaskLoader to prevent duplication of background threads and eliminate duplication of zombie activities.
2. Shared preference has been used to provide user the feature to switch between different categories of news and choose their country .
3. WebView is implemented to read the entire thread.
